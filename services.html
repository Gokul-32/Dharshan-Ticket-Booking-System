        <p>"The methods and technologies of how to experience that which is beyond the physical is what is known as the science of Yoga."
        <br>-Sadhguru<br>
        A Yoga asana is a certain posture that can take one to a higher dimension or higher perception of life.Yoga postures or asanas are not just about stretching and bending the body. In Sadhguru’s words, “Yogasanas are not exercises. They are very subtle processes of manipulating your energy in a certain direction. It needs to be done with a certain level of awareness. There are various levels of doing asanas. You can practice asanas just physically, or more deeply, being aware of the breath, sensations, reverberations, being aware of the nadis, or with appropriate mantras. You can even do asanas without moving a limb.”</p>

    <p>The International Day of Yoga is celebrated annually on 21 June. It was declared to be so by the <abbr title="United Nations General Assembly">UNGA</abbr> on December 11, 2014.
        The date of 21 June was chosen because it is the summer solstice

    <h3><em><font color="green">Meditation</font></em><img src="assets/753930_pillates_exercise_fitness_pilates_strength_icon.png" width="50px" height="50px"></h3>
    <p>Meditation is a powerful tool for spiritual growth, and is essentially a process to take one beyond the limitations of body and mind. Teachers and practitioners of these “inner technologies” have also experienced the many physical and mental benefits of meditation and Yoga. In recent years, a growing number of scientific studies and research on meditation have corroborated these experiences.Meditation offers numerous benefits, including stress reduction, improved focus, better sleep, enhanced emotional regulation, and potentially even a stronger immune system. It can also lead to increased self-awareness and self-compassion.</p>
